# Heart-disease-prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease using Machine Learning models. The dataset contains various health-related attributes (such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.), and the goal is to build an accurate classifier that can assist in early detection of heart-related issues.
